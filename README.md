# Morphogenesis
Visualizing Morphogenesis with the Processing Programming Language

# Introduction

The code here was developed under the supervision and direction of Tamira Elul, Associate Professor of Basic Sciences at Touro University _(http://www.tu.edu/faculty_staff/elul_tamira.prof.html)_. 

Computational visualization in Biology could benefit from artistic tools to enable more
aesthetic and appealing models. We applied Processing, a visual artists’ programming language 
developed at MIT, to model morphogenesis – the generation of form in embryonic tissues. Here, 
we describe our simulations of motility of neural cells responsible for elongating the spinal cord, 
and of dynamics of optic axon branching that establish primary visual connectivity. We also 
discuss possibilities for applying Processing and other visual languages to animate additional 
morphogenetic processes.

This code is designed to visualize dynamic cell behaviors driving morphogenesis in the developing nervous system. Based on timelapse video recordings and quantitative analysis of cell dynamics in tissues undergoing morphogenesis, we created models of two distinct processes in the developing nervous system.

First, the code in the file `MotileCell.pde` computationally models the cell motility that drives neural tube formation and spinal cord elongation in vertebrate embryos.

The code in `AxonBranching.pde` visualizes terminal branching of optic axonal arbors that establishes synaptic connectivity in the primary visual projection. These animations highlight the significance, and emphasize the aesthetic appeal, of the mathematical 
decomposition of dynamic cell behaviors underlying morphogenesis in the developing nervous 
system.
