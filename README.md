# Morphogenesis
Visualizing Morphogenesis with the Processing Programming Language

# Introduction
Computational visualization in Biology could benefit from artistic tools to enable more
aesthetic and appealing models. We applied Processing, a visual artists’ programming language 
developed at MIT, to model morphogenesis – the generation of form in embryonic tissues. Here, 
we describe our simulations of motility of neural cells responsible for elongating the spinal cord, 
and of dynamics of optic axon branching that establish primary visual connectivity. We also 
discuss possibilities for applying Processing and other visual languages to animate additional 
morphogenetic processes.
